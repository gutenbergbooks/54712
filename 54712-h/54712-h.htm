</div>

<h2>THE CASTLE OF MONEA, COUNTY OF FERMANAGH.</h2>

<p>The Castle of Monea or Castletown-Monea&mdash;properly <i lang="ga">Magh
an fhiaidh</i>, i.e. the plain of the deer&mdash;is situated in the parish
of Devinish, county of Fermanagh, and about five miles north-west
of Enniskillen. Like the Castle of Tully, in the same
county, of which we gave a view in a recent number, this
castle affords a good example of the class of castellated residences
erected on the great plantation of Ulster by the British
and Scottish undertakers, in obedience to the fourth article
concerning the English and Scottish undertakers, who “are to
plant their portions with English and inland-Scottish tenants,”
which was imposed upon them by “the orders and conditions to
be observed by the undertakers upon the distribution and plantation
of the escheated lands in Ulster,” in 1608. By this article
it was provided that “every undertaker of the <em>greatest
proportion</em> of two thousand acres shall, within two years after
the date of his letters patent, build thereupon a castle, with a
strong court or bawn about it; and every undertaker of the
second or <em>middle proportion</em> of fifteen hundred acres shall
within the same time build a stone or brick house thereupon,
with a strong court or bawn about it. And every undertaker
of the <em>least proportion</em> of one thousand acres shall within the
same time make thereupon a strong court or bawn at least;
and all the said undertakers shall cause their tenants to build
houses for themselves and their families, near the principal
castle, house, or bawn, for their mutual defence or
strength,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>Such was the origin of most of the castles and villages now
existing in the six escheated counties of Ulster&mdash;historical
memorials of a vast political movement&mdash;and among the rest
this of Monea, which was the castle of the <em>middle proportion</em>
of Dirrinefogher, of which Sir Robert Hamilton was the
first patentee.</p>

<p>From Pynnar’s Survey of Ulster, made in 1618-19, it appears
that this proportion had at that time passed into the
possession of Malcolm Hamilton (who was afterwards archbishop
of Cashel), by whom the castle was erected, though
the bawn, as prescribed by the conditions, was not added till
some years later. He says,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Upon this proportion there is a strong castle of lime and
stone, being fifty-four feet long and twenty feet broad, but
hath no bawn unto it, nor any other defence for the succouring
or relieving of his tenants.”</p>

</div>

<p>From an inquisition taken at Monea in 1630, we find, however,
that this want was soon after supplied, and that the
castle, which was fifty feet in height, was surrounded by a wall
nine feet in height and three hundred in circuit.</p>

<p>The Malcolm Hamilton noticed by Pynnar as possessor of
“the middle proportion of Dirrinefogher,” subsequently held
the rectory of Devenish, which he retained <i lang="la">in commendam</i> with
his archbishopric till his death in 1629. The proportion of Dirrinefogher,
however, with its castle, was escheated to the crown
in 1630; and shortly after, the old chapel of Monea was converted
into a parish church, the original church being inconveniently
situated on an island of Lough Erne.</p>

<p>Monea Castle served as a chief place of refuge to the
English and Scottish settlers of the vicinity during the rebellion
of 1641, and, like the Castle of Tully, it has its tales of
horror recorded in story; but we shall not uselessly drag
them to light. The village of Monea is an inconsiderable
one, but there are several gentlemen’s seats in its neighbourhood,
and the scenery around it is of great richness and beauty.</p>

<h2 class="gap4">ON THE SUBJUGATION OF ANIMALS BY MEANS
OF CHARMS, INCANTATIONS, OR DRUGS.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">First Article.</span><br />
<span class="smaller">ON SERPENT-CHARMING, AS PRACTISED BY THE
JUGGLERS OF ASIA.</span></h3>

<p>Many of my readers will doubtless recollect that in a paper
on “Animal Taming,” which appeared some weeks back in
the pages of this Journal, I alluded slightly to the <em>charming</em>
of animals, or <em>taming</em> them by spells or drugs. It is now my
purpose to enter more fully upon this subject, and present my
readers with a brief notice of what I have been able to glean
respecting it, as well from the published accounts of remarkable
travellers, as from oral descriptions received from personal
friends of my own, who had opportunities of being eye
witnesses to many of the practices to which I refer.</p>

<p>The most remarkable, and also the most ancient description
of animal-charming with which we are acquainted, is that
which consists in calling the venomous serpents from their
holes, quelling their fury, and allaying their irritation, by
means of certain charms, amongst which music stands forth in
the most prominent position, though, whether it really is worthy
of the first place as an actual agent, or is only thus put forward
to cover that on which the true secret depends, is by
no means perfectly clear.</p>

<p>Even in scripture we find the practice of serpent-charming
noticed, and by no means as a novelty; in the 58th Psalm we
are told that the wicked are like the “deaf adder that stoppeth
her ear, which hearkeneth not unto the voice of the
charmer, charm he never so wisely!” And in the book of
Jeremiah, chap. viii, the disobedient people are thus threatened&mdash;“Behold,
I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you,
which will not be <em>charmed</em>.” These are two very remarkable
passages, and I think we may, without going too far, set
down as snake-charmers the Egyptian magi who contended
against Moses and Aaron before the court of the proud and
vacillating Pharaoh, striving to imitate by their juggling
tricks the wondrous miracles which Moses wrought by the
immediate aid of God himself. The feat of changing their
sticks into serpents, for instance, is one of every-day performance
in India, which a friend of mine has assured me he many
times saw himself, and which has not been satisfactorily explained
by any one.</p>

<p>The serpent has long been an object of extreme veneration
to the natives of Hindostan, and has indeed, from the
very earliest ages, been selected by many nations as an object
of worship; why, I cannot explain, unless it originated in a
superstitious perversion of the elevation of the brazen serpent
in the wilderness by Moses. In India the serpent is not,
however, altogether regarded as a deity&mdash;merely as a <em>demon</em>
or genius: and the office usually supposed to be peculiar to
these creatures is that of <em>guardians</em>. This is perhaps one of
the most widely spread notions respecting the serpent that we
are acquainted with. Herodotus mentions the sacred serpents
which guarded the citadel of Athens, and which he
states to have been fed monthly with cakes of honey; and
adds, that these serpents being sacred, were harmless, and
would not hurt men. A dragon was said to have guarded
the golden fleece (or, as some think, a <em>scaly serpent</em>), and
protected the gardens of the Hesperides&mdash;a singular coincidence,
as it is of <em>gardens</em> principally that the Indians conceive
the serpent to be the guardian.</p>

<p>Medea <em>charmed</em> the dragon by the melody of her voice.
Herodotus mentions snakes being soothed by harmony; and
Virgil, in the Æneid, says (translated by Dryden),</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“His wand and holy words the viper’s rage</div>
<div class="verse">And venom’d wound of serpents could assuage.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Even our own island, although serpents do not exist in it&mdash;a
blessing for which, if we are to put faith in legendary lore,
we have to thank St Patrick&mdash;has numberless legends and
tales of crocks of treasure at the bottom of deep, deep lakes,
or in dark and gloomy caves, in inaccessible and rocky mountains,
guarded by a fierce and wakeful snake, a sleepless serpent,
whose eyes are never closed, and who never for a second
abated of his watchful care of the treasure-crock, of which
he had originally been appointed guardian;<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and, further, we
are told how the daring and inventive genius of the son of
Erin has often found out a mode of putting a “<i lang="ga">comether</i>” on
the “big sarpint, the villain,” and haply closing his eyes in
slumber, while he succeeded in possessing himself of the
hoard which by his cunning and bravery he had so fairly won;
in other words, <em>charming</em> the snake and possessing himself of
the spoil.</p>

<p>Having thus glanced at the antiquity and wide spread of
serpent-charming, I shall proceed to lay before you a short
description of the mode in which the spell is cast over the
animals by the modern jugglers of Arabia and India.</p>

<p>Of all the Indian serpents, next to the Cobra Minelle, the
Cobra Capella, or hooded snake (<i>Coluber Naja</i>), called in
India the “Naig,” and also “spectacle snake,” is the most venomous.
It derives its names of <em>hooded</em> and <em>spectacle</em> snake
from a fold of skin resembling a hood near the head, which it
possesses a power of enlarging or contracting at pleasure;
and in the centre of this hood are seen, when it is distended,
black and white markings, bearing no distant or fanciful likeness
to a pair of spectacles. The mode of charming, or, at all
events, all that is to be seen or understood by the spectators,
consists in the juggler playing upon a flute or fife near the
hole which a snake has been seen to enter, or which his employers
have otherwise reason to suppose the reptile inhabits.
The serpent will presently put forth his head, a portion of his
body will shortly follow, and in a few minutes he will creep
forth from his retreat, and, approaching the musician, rear
himself on his tail, and by moving his head and neck up and
down or from side to side, keep tolerably accurate time to the
tune with which his ears are ravished.</p>

<p>After having played for a short period, and apparently
soothed the reptile into a state of dreamy unconsciousness
of all that is passing, save only the harmony which delights
him, the juggler will gradually bring himself within grasp of
the snake, and by a sudden snatch seize him by the tail, and
hold him out at arms’ length. On the cessation of the music,
and on finding himself thus roughly assailed, the reptile becomes
fearfully enraged, and exerts all his energies to turn
upwards, and bite the arm of his aggressor. His efforts are
however fruitless; while held in that position, he is utterly
incapable of doing any injury; and is, after having been held
thus for a few minutes before the gaze of the admiring crowd,
dropped into a basket ready to receive him, and laid aside
until the juggler has leisure and privacy to complete the subjugation
which his wonder-working melody had begun.</p>

<p>When charmed serpents are exhibited dancing to the
sound of music, the spectators should not crowd too closely
around the seat of the juggler, for, no matter how well trained
they may be, there is great danger attending the cessation of
the sweet sounds; and if from any cause the flute or fife suddenly
stops or is checked, it not unfrequently happens that the
snake will spring upon some one of the company, and bite him.
I think that it will not be amiss if I quote the description of
Indian snake-charming, furnished by a gentleman in the Honourable
Company’s civil service at Madras, to the writer,
who vouches for its veracity:&mdash;</p>

<p>“One morning,” says he, “as I sat at breakfast, I heard a
loud noise and shouting among my palankeen bearers. On
inquiry I learned that they had seen a large hooded snake (or
Cobra Capella), and were trying to kill it. I immediately
went out, and saw the snake climbing up a very high green
mound, whence it escaped into a hole in an old wall of an
ancient fortification. The men were armed with their sticks,
which they always carry in their hands, and had attempted in
vain to kill the reptile, which had eluded their pursuit, and in
his hole he had coiled himself up secure, while we could see
his bright eyes shining. I had often desired to ascertain the
truth of the report as to the effect of music upon snakes:
I therefore inquired for a snake catcher. I was told there was
no person of the kind in the village, but, after a little inquiry
I heard there was one in a village distant three miles. I
accordingly sent for him, keeping a strict watch over the
snake, which never attempted to escape whilst we his enemies
were in sight. About an hour elapsed, when my messenger
returned, bringing the snake catcher. This man wore no
covering on his head, nor any on his person, excepting a
small piece of cloth round his loins: he had in his hands two
baskets, one containing tame snakes, one empty: these and
his musical pipe were the only things he had with him. I
made the snake catcher leave his two baskets on the ground at
some distance, while he ascended the mound with his pipe
alone. He began to play: at the sound of the music the
snake came gradually and slowly out of his hole. When he
was entirely within reach, the snake catcher seized him dexterously
by the tail, and held him thus at arms’ length,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
whilst the enraged snake darted his head in all directions,
but in vain: thus suspended, he has not the power to round
himself so as to seize hold of his tormentor. He exhausted
himself in vain exertions, when the snake catcher descended
the bank, dropped him into the empty basket, and closed the
lid: he then began to play, and after a short time raised the
lid of the basket, when the snake darted about wildly, and
attempted to escape; the lid was shut down again quickly, the
music always playing. This was repeated two or three times;
and in a very short interval, the lid being raised, the snake sat
on his tail, opened his hood, and danced quite as quietly as the
tame snakes in the other basket, nor did he again attempt to
escape. This, having witnessed it with my own eyes, I can
assert as a fact.”</p>

<p>I particularly request the attention of my readers to the
foregoing account, as, from the circumstance of its having
been furnished by an eye-witness, and a man whose public
station and known character were sufficient to command belief
in his veracity, it will prove serviceable to me by and bye,
when I shall endeavour to disprove the ridiculous assertions
of Abbé Dubois<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and others, who hold that serpent-charming
is a mere imposition, and assert, certainly without a shade of
warranty for so doing, that the serpents are in these cases
always previously tamed, and deprived of their poison bags and
fangs, when they are let loose in certain situations for the
purpose of being artfully caught again, and represented as
<em>wild</em> snakes, subdued by the charms of their pipe. I shall,
however, say no more at present of Dubois, Denon, or others
who are sceptical on this subject, but shall leave the refutation
of their fanciful opinions to another opportunity&mdash;my
present purpose being the establishment of <em>facts</em>, ere I venture
to advance a theory.</p>

<p>I shall therefore conclude my present paper, and in my
next, besides adducing many other important facts relative to
serpent-charming, shall endeavour to throw some light upon
the real mode by which it is effected.</p>

<h2 class="gap4">GRUMBLING.</h2>

<p>If it be no part of the English constitution, it is certainly part
of the constitution of Englishmen to grumble. They cannot
help it, even if they tried; not that they ever do try, quite
the reverse, but they could not help grumbling if they tried
ever so much. A true-born Englishman is born grumbling.
He grumbles at the light, because it dazzles his eyes, and he
grumbles at the darkness, because it takes away the light.
He grumbles when he is hungry, because he wants to eat; he
grumbles when he is full, because he can eat no more. He
grumbles at the winter, because it is cold; he grumbles at
the summer, because it is hot; and he grumbles at spring and
autumn, because they are neither hot nor cold. He grumbles
at the past, because it is gone; he grumbles at the future,
because it is not come; and he grumbles at the present, because
it is neither the past nor the future. He grumbles at
law, because it restrains him; and he grumbles at liberty,
because it does not restrain others. He grumbles at all the
elements&mdash;fire, water, earth, and air. He grumbles at fire,
because it is so dear; at water, because it is so foul; at the
earth, in all its combinations of mud, dust, bricks, and sand;
and at the air, in all its conditions of hot or cold, wet or dry.
All the world seems as if it were made for nothing else than
to plague Englishmen, and set them a-grumbling. The Englishman
must grumble at nature for its rudeness, and at art
for its innovation; at what is old, because he is tired of it;
and at what is new, because he is not used to it. He grumbles
at everything that is to be grumbled at; and when there is
nothing to grumble at, he grumbles at that. Grumbling
cleaves to him in all the departments of life; when he is well,
he grumbles at the cook; and when he is ill, he grumbles at
the doctor and nurse. He grumbles in his amusements, and
he grumbles in his devotion; at the theatres he grumbles at
the players, and at church he grumbles at the parson. He
cannot for the life of him enjoy a day’s pleasure without
grumbling. He grumbles at his enemies, and he grumbles at
his friends. He grumbles at all the animal creation, at
horses when he rides on them, at dogs when he shoots with
them, at birds when he misses them, at pigs when they squeak,
at asses when they bray, at geese when they cackle, and at
peacocks when they scream. He is always on the look-out for
something to grumble at; he reads the newspapers, that he
may grumble at public affairs; his eyes are always open to
look for abominations; he is always pricking up his ears to
detect discords, and snuffing up the air to find stinks. Can
you insult an Englishman more than by telling him he has
nothing to grumble at? Can you by any possibility inflict a
greater injury upon him than by convincing him he has no
occasion to grumble? Break his head, and he will forget it;
pick his pocket, and he will forgive it, but deprive him of his
privilege of grumbling, you more than kill him&mdash;you expatriate
him. But the beauty of it is, you cannot inflict this
injury on him; you cannot by all the logic ever invented, or
by all the arguments that ever were uttered, convince an
Englishman that he has nothing to grumble at; for if you
were to do so, he would grumble at you so long as he lived
for disturbing his old associations. Grumbling is a pleasure
which we all enjoy more or less, but none, or but few, enjoy
it in all the perfection and completeness of which it is capable.
If we were to take a little more pains, we should find, that
having no occasion to grumble, we should have cause to
grumble at everything. But we grow insensible to a great
many annoyances, and accustomed to a great many evils, and
think nothing of them. What a tremendous noise there is in
the city, of carts, coaches, drays, waggons, barrel-organs,
fish-women, and all manner of abominations, of which they in
the city take scarcely any notice at all! How badly are all
matters in government and administration conducted! What
very bad bread do the bakers make! What very bad meat
do the butchers kill! In a word, what is there in the whole
compass of existence that is good? What is there in human
character that is as it should be? Are we not justified in
grumbling at everything that is in heaven above, or in the
earth beneath, or in the waters under the earth? In fact,
gentle reader, is the world formed or governed half so well as
you or I could form or govern it?&mdash;<cite>From a newspaper.</cite></p>

<h2 class="gap4">VULGARITY.</h2>

<p>The very essence of vulgarity, after all, consists merely
in one error&mdash;in taking manners, actions, words, opinions,
on trust from others, without examining one’s own feelings,
or weighing the merits of the case. It is coarseness
or shallowness of taste, arising from want of individual refinement,
together with the confidence and presumption inspired
by example and numbers. It may be defined to be a prostitution
of the mind or body to ape the more or less obvious defects
of others, because by so doing we shall secure the suffrages
of those we associate with. To affect a gesture, an
opinion, a phrase, because it is the rage with a large number
of persons, or to hold it in abhorrence because another set of
persons very little, if at all, better informed, cry it down to
distinguish themselves from the former, is in either case equal
vulgarity and absurdity. A thing is not vulgar merely because
it is common. It is common to breathe, to see, to feel,
to live. Nothing is vulgar that is natural, spontaneous, unavoidable.
Grossness is not vulgarity, ignorance is not vulgarity,
awkwardness is not vulgarity; but all these become
vulgar when they are affected and shown off on the authority
of others, or to fall in with the fashion or the company we
keep. Caliban is coarse enough, but surely he is not vulgar.
We might as well spurn the clod under our feet, and call it
vulgar. Cobbett is coarse enough, but he is not vulgar. He
does not belong to the herd. Nothing real, nothing original,
can be vulgar; but I should think an imitator of Cobbett a
vulgar man. Simplicity is not vulgarity; but the looking to
imitation or affectation of any sort for distinction is. A Cockney
is a vulgar character, whose imagination cannot wander
beyond the suburbs of the metropolis. An aristocrat, also,
who is always thinking of the High Street, Edinburgh, is vulgar.
We want a name for this last character. An opinion
is often vulgar that is stewed in the rank breath of the rabble;
but it is not a bit purer or more refined for having passed
through the well-cleansed teeth of a whole court. The inherent
vulgarity lies in the having no other feeling on any subject
than the crude, blind, headlong, gregarious notion
acquired by sympathy with the mixed multitude, or with
a fastidious minority, who are just as insensible to the real
truth, and as indifferent to every thing but their own frivolous
pretensions. The upper are not wiser than the lower
orders, because they resolve to differ from them. The
fashionable have the advantage of the unfashionable in nothing
but the fashion. The true vulgar are the persons
who have a horrible dread of daring to differ from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
clique&mdash;the herd of pretenders to what they do not feel, and
to do what is not natural to them, whether in high or low life.
To belong to any class, to move in any rank or sphere of life,
is not a very exclusive distinction or test of refinement.
Refinement will in all classes be the exception, not the rule;
and the exception may occur in one class as well as another.
A king is but a man with a hereditary title. A nobleman
is only one of the House of Peers. To be a knight or alderman&mdash;above
all, to desire being either, is confessedly a
vulgar thing. The king made Walter Scott a baronet, but
not all the power of the Three Estates could make another
“Author of Waverley.” Princes, heroes, are often commonplace
people, and sometimes the reverse; Hamlet was not a
vulgar character, neither was Don Quixote. To be an author,
to be a painter, one of the many, is nothing. It is a trick, it
is a trade. Nay, to be a member of the Royal Academy, or
a Fellow of the Royal Society, is but a vulgar distinction.
But to be a Virgil, a Milton, a Raphael, a Claude, is what
falls to the lot of humanity but once. I do not think those
were vulgar people, though, for any thing I know to the contrary,
the First Lord of the Bedchamber may be a very vulgar
man. Such are pretty much my notions with regard to vulgarity.&mdash;<cite>Hazlitt’s

<p>One evening last winter&mdash;a holiday evening too&mdash;when the
western wind was sweeping on wild pinions from the grey
hills of Tipperary, athwart the rich and level plains of the
Queen’s County, when the blast roared down in the chimney,
and the huge rain-drops pattered saucily against the four
tiny panes which constituted the little kitchen window, I
was sitting in the cottage of a neighbouring peasant, amid a
small but happy group of village rustics, and enjoying with
them that enlivening mirth and sinless delight which I have
never found any where but at the fireside of an Irish peasant.
The earthen floor was well scrubbed over; the “brullaws ov
furnithure” were arranged with more than usual tidiness, and
even the crockery on the well-scoured dresser reflected the
ruddy glare of the red fire with redoubled brilliancy, and glittered
and glistened as merrily as if they felt conscious of the
calm and tranquillity of that happy scene. And happy indeed
was that scene, and happy was that time, and happier still the
hearts of the laughing rustics by whom I was on that occasion
surrounded, and amongst whom I have spent the lightest
and happiest hours of my existence.</p>

<p>It was, as I said, a wild night, but even the violence of the
weather abroad gave an additional relish to the enjoyments
within. The blast whistled fiercely in the bawn and in the
haggard, but the huge fire blazed brightly on the hearth-stone.
The rain fell in torrents; but, as one of the company chucklingly
remarked, “the wrong side ov the house was out,”
and I myself mentally exclaimed with Tam o’ Shanter,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The storm without may roar and rustle,</div>
<div class="verse"><em>We</em> do not mind the storm a whustle.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Whilst, to wind up the climax of our happiness, a gossoon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
who had been dispatched for a grey-beard full of “the native,”
now returned, and in a few minutes a huge jug of half and
half smoked on the table, and was circulated around the smiling
and expectant ring, with an impetus of which the peasantry
of Ireland will in a short time, from certain existing causes,
have not even the remotest idea.</p>

<p>Well! such an evening as we had, I shall never forget; it
would be vain to attempt a description. Those who have
witnessed similar scenes require none, and to those who have
not, any attempt at one would be useless. All therefore I
shall say, is, that such a scene of fun and frolic and harmless
waggery could not be found any where outside that ring which
encircles the Emerald Isle, and even within that bright zone,
nowhere but in the cabin of an Irish “scullogue.”</p>

<p>The songs of our sires, chanted with all that melancholy
softness and pathetic sweetness for which the voices of our wild
Irish girls are remarkable, the wild legend recited with that
rich brogue and waggish humour peculiar alone to the Irish
peasant, and the romantic and absurd fairy tale, told with all
the reverential awe and caution which the solemnity of the
subject required, long amused and excited the captivated
auditors; but at length, more’s the pity, the vocalist could
sing no more, having “a mighty great could intirely.” The
story-teller was “as dry as a chip wid all he talked,” and
even the sides of most of the company “war ready to split
wid the rale dint of laughin’;” whilst, as if to afford us another
illustration of the truth of the old proverb, “one trouble never
comes alone,” even the old crone who had astonished us with
the richness and extent of her fairy lore, was also knocked up,
or rather knocked <em>down</em>, for the quantity of earthly <em>spirits</em>
she had put <em>in</em>, entirely put <em>out</em> all memory of <em>un</em>-earthly
<em>spirits</em>, and sent her disordered fancy, all confused as it was,
wool-gathering to the classic regions of <i lang="ga">Their-na-noge</i>.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Well, what was to be done? It was still young in the night,
and, better than that, a good “slug” still remained in the
grey-beard, and as we all had contributed to procure the
stock, so all declared that none should depart until the very
last drop was drained. But how was the interval to be employed?
The singer was hushed, the story-teller was exhausted,
and vollies of wit and waggery had exploded until every one
was tired; yet to remain silent was considered by all as the
highest degree of discomfort. In this dilemma the man of the
house scratched his pericranium, and, as acting by some sudden
impulse, started up and handed me an old sooty book,
“hoping that I would read a wollume for the edication of the
company, until it would be time to retire.”</p>

<p>I agreed without hesitation, and on opening the dusty and
smoke-begrimed volume found that it was “Sir Charles
Coote’s Statistical Survey of the Queen’s County,” printed
in Dublin by Graisberry and Campbell, and published by
direction of the Dublin Society in the year 1801. Although
well aware that the dry details of a work professedly and almost
exclusively statistical, were little calculated to amuse or
interest <em>such</em> an audience, yet, as the library of an Irish
peasant is always unfortunately scanty, and in this instance,
with the exception of a few trifling works on religious subjects,
limited to the book in question, I determined to make
the best I could of it, and for that purpose opened it at Sir
Charles’s description of the immediate district in which we
were situated, namely, the barony of Maryborough West,
and town-land of Killeany. I read on thus:&mdash;“On Sir Allen
Johnson’s estate stand the ruins of Killeany Castle; the
walls are injudiciously built of very bad stones, though
excellent quarry is contiguous. … Poor-man’s Bridge
over the Nore was lately widened, and is very safe, but I
cannot learn the tradition why it was so called.”</p>

<p>“Read that again, sir,” said a fine grey-headed, patriarchal
old man who was present; “read that again,” said he
emphatically. I did so.</p>

<p>“<em>He</em> cannot learn the tradition of Poor-man’s Bridge,
<i lang="ga">inagh</i>!” said the old man with a sneer; “faith, I believe not;
I’d take his word for more nor that. But had he come to me
when he was travelling the country making up his statisticks,
I could open his eyes on that subject, and many others too.”</p>

<p>Some of those present laughed outright at the old man’s
gravity of manner as he made this confident boast.</p>

<p>“You need not laugh&mdash;you may shut your potato-traps,”
said the old man indignantly. “Grand as he was, with his
gold and silver, his coach and horses, and servants with gold
and scarlet livery, I could enlighten him more on the ancient
history and traditions of our country than all the <i lang="ga">boddaghs</i> of
squireens whom he visited on his tour through the Queen’s
County.”</p>

<p>These assertions served only to increase the storm of ridicule
which was gathering around the old man’s head; and to
put a stop to any bad blood which the occasion might call
forth, I requested of him to tell us the tradition of “the
Boccough Ruadh.”</p>

<p>After some wheedling and flattery he complied, and told a
curious story, of which the following is the substance.</p>

<p>The river Nore flows through a district of the Queen’s
County celebrated for fertility and romantic beauty. From its
source amongst the blue hills of Slievebloom to its termination
at New Ross, where its bright ripples commingle with the
briny billows of the Irish sea, many excellent and even some
beautiful bridges span its stream. Until the commencement
of the last century, however, except in the vicinity of towns,
there were but few permanent bridges across this river, and
in the country districts access was gained over it chiefly by
means of causeways, or, as they are termed, “foords,” constructed
of stones and huge blocks of timber fixed firmly in
the bed of the river, and extending in irregular succession
from bank to bank. Over this pathway foot passengers
crossed easily enough, but cattle and wheeled carriages were
obliged to struggle through the water as well as they could;
but in time of floods, and in the winter season when the
waters were swollen, all communication was cut off except
to pedestrians alone.</p>

<p>One of those “foords,” in former times, crossed the Nore
at Shanahoe, a very pretty neighbourhood, about three miles
northwards of the beautiful and rising town of Abbeyleix, in
the Queen’s County. The river here winds its course through
a silent glen, and now several snug cottages and farm-houses
arise above its banks at either side. The country in this
neighbourhood is remarkably beautiful. Several gentlemen’s
seats are scattered along the banks of the river in this vicinity,
all elegant and of modern erection, whilst swelling hills,
sloping dales, gloomy groves, and ruins of church and tower
and “castle grey,” ornament and diversify the scene.</p>

<p>On a gentle eminence on the eastern bank of the river,
stood, about a hundred years ago, the cabin of a man named
Neale O’Shea. At that period there was not another dwelling
within a long distance of the “foord,” and many a time
was Neale summoned from his midnight repose to guide the
traveller in his passage over the lonely and dangerous river
pathway.</p>

<p>One wild stormy December night, when the huge limestone
rocks that formed the stepping-stones of the ford were lashed
and chafed by the angry foam of the agitated river, Neale
O’Shea’s wife fancied she heard, amid the fitful pausings of
the wind, the cry of some mortal in distress. She immediately
aroused her husband, who was stretched asleep on a large
oak stool in the chimney corner, and told him to look out.
Neale, ever willing to relieve a fellow-creature, arose, and,
flinging his grey “trusty” over his expansive shoulders, and
seizing a long iron-shod pole or wattle, the constant companion
of his nightly excursions, hastened down to the river’s brink.
He stood a moment at the verge of the ford, and tried to
penetrate through the intense gloom, to see if he could discover
a human form, but he could see nothing.</p>

<p>“Is there any one there?” he shouted in a stentorian voice,
which rose high above the whistling of the blast, and the
brawling of the angry and swift-rushing river.</p>

<p>A voice sounded at the other extremity of the ford, and
the stout-hearted peasant, with steady step, crossed over the
slippery stepping-stones.</p>

<p>“Who the devil are you?” roughly exclaimed Neale to a
man who lay extended on the brink of the river, convenient
to the entrance of the ford.</p>

<p>“Whoever I am,” faintly replied the stranger, “you are
my good angel, and it was surely Providence who sent you
this night to rescue me from a watery grave.”</p>

<p>“Whoever you are,” again said Neale, “come along with
me, and Kathleen and the childre will make you welcome in
my cabin until morning.” So saying, he seized the bending
form of the wayworn stranger, and flinging him on his back
with herculean strength, trudged over the stepping-stones,
chuckling with delight, and gaily whistling as he went.</p>

<p>The dangerous pass was soon crossed, and arriving at the
door, Neale pushed it before him, and with a smile deposited
his trembling burthen on the warm hearth. A fine fire blazed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
merrily, and its flickering beams fell brightly on the face of
the stranger. He was a tall, portly figure, stooped as if from
extreme suffering more than age, and had a wooden leg.
His features, which had evidently been handsome in his youth,
were worn, pale, and attenuated, and he might be about fifty
years of age. His clothes were faded and ragged; he was
entirely without shoes or stockings; and his head was covered
by a broad-brimmed leathern hat, under which he wore an
enormous red nightcap of coarse woollen cloth.</p>

<p>The good Kathleen now set about preparing supper, and
while thus employed, the stranger gave them a brief account
of his bygone life. He told them that he was a native of the
north of Ireland, and that he had spent several years of his
youth at sea; that being wounded in a fray with smugglers
on the coast of France, and losing his leg, he was discharged
from his employment, and sent adrift on the world, without
having one friend on earth, or a penny in his pocket. In this
exigence he had no alternative but to apply to the commiseration
of his fellow-creatures, and had thus for the last twenty
years wandered up and down, entirely dependent on the
bounty and charity of the public.</p>

<p>Supper was now ready, and having partaken of a comfortable
meal, the wanderer went to rest in a comfortable “shake-down,”
which the good woman had prepared for him in the
chimney corner. The storm died away during the night, and
next morning the watery beams of the winter’s sun shone
faintly yet gaily on the smooth surface of the silvery Nore.</p>

<p>The stranger was up at sunrise, and was preparing to depart,
but his kind host and hostess would not permit him to
go. They told him to stop a few days to rest himself, and in
the interim, that he could not do better than take his stand at
the ford, and ask alms of those who passed the way, as a great
many frequented that pass; and as nothing was ever craved
from them there, they would cheerfully extend their charity
to an object worthy of relief.</p>

<p>Acting on their suggestions, the old sailor was soon sitting
on a stone at the western extremity of the ford. With his
old caubeen in his hand, and his head enveloped in the gigantic
red nightcap, he craved alms, in the name of God and the
Virgin, from all who passed the way; and before the sickly
beams of the December sun had sunk behind the conical
“Gizebo,” he could show more money than ever he did before,
since his limb was swept off by the shot of the smuggling
Frenchman.</p>

<p>The next morning, and every morning after, found the
sailor at his post at the ford: he soon became well known to
all the villagers, and from the circumstance of his always
appearing with no other head-gear than the red nightcap, they
nicknamed him the “Boccough Ruadh,”<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> a name by which he
went ever after till his death.</p>

<p>Time passed on as usual, and the one-legged sailor still
plied his lucrative vocation at the river pass. Neale O’Shea’s
cabin still continued to afford him shelter every night, and all
his days, from the crow of the cock to the vesper song of the
wood-thrush, were passed at the ford, seated on that remarkable
block of limestone called to this day the “Clough-na-Boccough.”<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
His hand was stretched to every stranger for
alms, “for the good of their souls,” and very few passed without
giving more or less to the Boccough Ruadh. Thus he
acquired considerable sums of money, but constantly denied
having a “keenogue;” but when bantered by any of the
neighbouring urchins on the length of his purse, he would get
into a great rage, and swear, by the cross of his crutch, that
between buying the shough of tobacco and paying for other
things he wanted, he hadn’t as much as would jingle on a
tomb-stone, or what would buy a farthing candle to show
light to his poor corpse at the last day. His food was of the
very worst description, and unless supplied by the kind-hearted
Kathleen O’Shea, he would sooner go to bed supperless than
lay out one penny to buy bread. He suffered his clothes to
go to rags, unless when any person in the neighbourhood
would give him old clothes for charity, and he would not pay
for soap to wash his shirt once in the twelvemonth. Yet
no one could find out what he did with his money; he did not
spend two-and-sixpence in the year, and it was people’s
opinion that he was hoarding it up to give for the benefit of
his soul at his dying day.</p>

<p>Years rolled away, and Neale O’Shea having now waxed
old, died, and was gathered to his fathers in the adjacent
green churchyard of Shannikill,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> on the banks of the winding
Nore. The Boccough followed the remains of his kind benefactor
to his last earthly resting-place, and poured his sorrows
over his grave in loud and long-continued lamentations.
But though Neale was gone, Kathleen remained, and she
promised that while she lived, neither son nor daughter should
ever turn out the Boccough Ruadh.</p>

<p>It was now forty years since the Boccough first crossed the
waters of the Nore, and still he was constantly to be found
from morning till night on his favourite stone at the river side.
In the mean time, all O’Shea’s children were married, and
separated through various parts of the country, with the exception
of Terry, the youngest, a fine stout fellow, now about
thirty-five years of age, who still remained in a state of single
blessedness, and said he would continue so, “until he would
be after laying the last sod on his poor ould mother.” With
gigantic strength, he inherited all his father’s kindness of
heart and undaunted bravery, and he was particularly attentive
to the Boccough, whom he regarded with the same affection
as a child would a parent.</p>

<p>One morning in summer, the Boccough was observed to
remain in bed longer than was his custom, and thinking that
he might be unwell, Terry went to his bedside, and demanded
why he was not up as usual.</p>

<p>“Ah, Terry, <i lang="ga">alanna</i>,” said the old man sorrowfully, “I will
never get up again until I do upon the bearer.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> My days are
spent, and I know it, for there is something over me that I
cannot describe, and I won’t be alive in twenty-four hours;”
and as he said these words, he heaved a deep groan, whilst
Terry, wiping his eyes with the sleeve of his coat, wept
bitterly.</p>

<p>“Will I go for the priest?” demanded Terry, sobbing as
if his heart would break.</p>

<p>“No,” replied the old man sorrowfully, “I do not want him.
It is long since I complied with my religious duties, and now
I feel it is useless.”</p>

<p>“There is mercy still,” replied Terry; “you know the
ould sayin’,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Mercy craved and mercy found</div>
<div class="verse">Between the saddle and the ground.’”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The old man replied not, but shook his head, indicating his
determination to die without the consolations of religion,
whilst Terry trembled for his hopeless situation.</p>

<p>“Well, since you won’t have the priest, will you give me
some money till I bring you the doctor?” said Terry.</p>

<p>The old man’s eyes literally flashed fire, his form heaved
with rage, and his countenance displayed demoniac indignation.</p>

<p>“What’s that you say?” he demanded in a ferocious tone.</p>

<p>Terry repeated the question.</p>

<p>“Send for a doctor!&mdash;give you money!” echoed the old
man. “Where the devil would I get money to pay a doctor?”</p>

<p>“You have it, and ten times as much,” said Terry, “and
you cannot deny it.”</p>

<p>“If I have as much money as would buy me a coffin,” said
the Boccough, “may my soul never rest quiet in the grave.”</p>

<p>Terry crossed his brow with terror. He knew the unhappy
wretch was dying with a lie on his tongue, but he resolved
not to press the matter further.</p>

<p>“You are dying as fast as you can,” remarked Terry;
“have you any thing to say before you go?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” replied he faintly. “But let me be buried
with my red nightcap on me.”</p>

<p>“Your wish must be granted,” said Terry, and he went to
awake his old mother, who still lay asleep. When he returned,
he found the old man breathing his last. He uttered a convulsive
groan, and expired.</p>

<p>He was washed and stretched, and waked, with all the
honours, rites, and ceremonies belonging to a genuine Irish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
wake; and on the third day following, being the Sabbath, he
was followed to the grave by crowds of the village peasantry,
who remained in the churchyard until they saw his remains
deposited, as they thought for ever, in the rank soil of the
“City of the Dead.”</p>

<p>Many rumours were now current respecting the Boccough’s
money. Every one but Terry believed that the “lob” fell
with Terry himself. But Terry, who knew better, believed
and affirmed that “what was got under the devil’s belly, always
goes over his back,” and that the “old boy” had taken
the spoil, and that it lay concealed in some crevice in the bank
of the river.</p>

<p>The night following the burial of the old sailor was passed
in a very disturbed and agitated manner by Terry O’Shea:
he could not sleep a wink; and when he fell into a slumber,
he started and moaned, and appeared frightened and annoyed.</p>

<p>“What ails you?” affectionately demanded his old mother,
who slept in the same room, and who was kept awake by her
son’s restless and disturbed manner.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, mother,” said Terry; “I am so frightened
and tormented with dreaming of the Boccough Ruadh, that I
am almost out of my natural senses. Even at this moment I
think I see him walking the room before me.”</p>

<p>“Holy Mary, protect us!” ejaculated the old woman.
“And it is no wonder that his misforthunate soul would be
star-gazing about&mdash;and to die without the priest, and a curse
and a lie in his mouth!”</p>

<p>Terry groaned agitatedly.</p>

<p>“And how does he appear in your dreams?” asked the old
woman.</p>

<p>“As he always was,” replied Terry. “But I think I see
him pointing to his red nightcap, and endeavouring to pull it
off with his old withered hand.”</p>

<p>“Umph!” said the old woman, in a knowing tone. “Ha!
ha! I have it now. Are you sure that the strings of his
nightcap were unloosed before he was nailed up in the coffin?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“I’ll go bail they weren’t,” said the old woman; “and you
know, or at any rate you ought to know, that a corpse can
never rest in the grave when there is a knot or a tie upon
any thing belonging to its grave-dress.”</p>

<p>Terry emitted another deep groan.</p>

<p>“Well, <i lang="ga">acushla</i>,” said the old mother, “go to-morrow, and
take a neighbour with you, and open the grave, and see if any
thing be asthray. If you find the nightcap or any thing else
not as it should be, set it to rights, and close the grave again
decently, and he will trouble you no more.”</p>

<p>“God send,” was Terry’s brief but emphatic response.</p>

<p>Early next morning Terry was at the Boccough’s grave,
accompanied by a man of the neighbourhood. The coffin was
opened, the corpse examined, and, according to the mother’s
prediction, the red nightcap was found knotted tightly under
the dead man’s chin. Terry proceeded to unloosen it, and in
the act of doing so, a corner of the nightcap gave way, and
out peeped a shining golden guinea.</p>

<p>“Ah ha!” mentally exclaimed Terry, “that’s no blind nut
any how; there’s more where that was, but I had better keep
a hard cheek!” So, without seeming to appear any way affected,
he opened the knot, closed the coffin, shut up the grave,
and departed homewards, without acquainting his comrade
with what he had seen.</p>

<p>The moment Terry entered his own door, he told his mother
about the guinea, and expressed his determination to go that
very night, and fetch the red nightcap home with him, “body
and bones and all,” “for,” added he, “that guinea has its
comrade; and I’ll hold you a halfpenny there’s where the old
dog has the ‘lob’ concealed, and that’s what made him order
me to have the red cap buried with him.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="ga">Asthore machree</i>,” said the mother doubtingly, “won’t you
be afraid?”</p>

<p>“Afraid!” echoed Terry, “devil a bit&mdash;afraid indeed! and
my fortune perhaps in the red nightcap.”</p>

<p>The mother consented, but enjoined him to tell nobody
about the matter for fear of disappointment. Terry vowed
implicit obedience, and retired to his usual avocations in the
garden.</p>

<p>Well, at last the night came, and Terry set about preparing
for his strange undertaking. All the arts and prayers
and charms of old Kathleen were put in requisition to preserve
him from danger; and about the witching hour of twelve,
with his spade on his shoulder, and his dhudeen in his mouth,
the bold-hearted Terry set forward all alone to the grave-yard,
shaping his course by the winding banks of the glassy
river, and whistling as he went&mdash;not “for want of thought,”
however, for never was man’s mind more busily occupied than
was Terry’s, in predisposing of the money which he expected
to find in the Boccough Ruadh’s nightcap.</p>

<p>After a short walk, Terry arrived at the precincts of the
churchyard. It was a lovely summer’s night, the full moon
shining gloriously, and myriads of pretty stars blinking and
twinkling in the blue expanse, but all their native lustre was
drowned in the borrowed splendour of the Queen of Heaven.
Terry stood a moment to reconnoitre, and, resting on his
spade, looked around with an anxious gaze. He could discover
nothing; all was silent as the departed beneath his feet,
except the murmuring of the river’s surges in the rear, or
the barking of some village cur-dog in the hazy distance. He
advanced to the grave of the Boccough, and in a few minutes
the ghastly moonbeams shone full on the pale grim features
of the dead. He snatched the nightcap quickly from the bald
head of the corpse, put it in his pocket, and, notwithstanding
the awe and superhuman terror under which he laboured, he
chuckled with delight as he remarked the “<em>dead</em> weight” of
the Boccough’s head-gear. He then closed the coffin, and as
he proceeded to cover it, the clay and stones fell on it with an
appalling and unearthly sound. The grave now covered up,
the intrepid fellow again shouldered his spade, and sought the
river’s margin, and as he strode hurriedly along its banks in
the direction of his home, the splash of the otter and the diving
of the water-hen more than once broke the thread of his
lonely musings.</p>

<p>Terry was soon at his mother’s side, who since his departure
had been on her knees, praying for his safe return. The
nightcap was ripped up, and lo! three hundred golden guineas
were the reward of Terry’s churchyard adventure!
Stitched carefully in every part of the huge nightcap, the
gold lay secure, so as not to attract the notice of any one, or
cause the least suspicion of its proximity to the old man’s
pericranium.</p>

<p>Terry and his mother were in ecstacies. Farms were
already purchased in ideality, cattle bought, houses built, and
even Terry began in his mind to make preparations for his
wedding with Onny Kinshellagh, a rich farmer’s daughter of
the neighbourhood, for whom he had breathed many a hopeless
sigh, and who, in addition to her beauty, was possessed of
fifty pounds in hard gold, a couple of good yearlings, and a
feather-bed as broad as the “nine acres.”</p>

<p>The mother and son retired to bed, as happy as the certain
possession of wealth, and the almost as certain expectations
of honour and distinction, could make them. After a long
time spent in constructing and condemning schemes for the
future, Terry fell asleep. He had not slept long, however,
when he started up with a loud scream, crying out, “the Boccough!
the Boccough!” “Och, weary’s on him for a Boccough!”
exclaimed the mother; “is he coming for the nightcap
and the goold?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said Terry, calmly; “but I was again dreaming
of him, and I was frightened.”</p>

<p>“What did you dream to-night?” asked the old woman.</p>

<p>“I was dreaming that I was going over the foord by moonlight,
and that I saw the Boccough walking on the water
towards me; that he stopped at a certain big stone, and
began to examine under with his hands; that I came up, and
asked him what he was searching for, when he looked up with
a frightful phiz, and cried out in a horrible voice, ‘For my
red nightcap!’”</p>

<p>“God Almighty never opened one door but he opened two,”
exclaimed old Kathleen. “Examine under that stone to-morrow,
and by all the cottoners in Cork, you’ll find another
‘lob’ of money in it.”</p>

<p>“Faix, maybe so,” replied Terry; “it’s no harm to say
‘Godsend,’ and that God may make a thief of you before a
<em>liar</em>.”</p>

<p>“Amen, <i lang="ga">achiernah</i>,” replied Kathleen.</p>

<p>Next morning at daybreak, Terry got up, and proceeded
to the identical stone where he fancied that he had seen the
spirit of the Boccough. He examined it closely, and after a
strict search, discovered in the sand beneath the rock a leathern
pouch full of money. He seized it joyfully, and on counting
its contents, found it amounted to upwards of a hundred
pounds, all in silver and copper coins.</p>

<p>“What a lucky born man you are, Terry O’Shea!” cried
the overjoyed gold-finder, “and what a bright day it was for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
your family that the Boccough Ruadh crossed over the
waters of the Nore.”</p>

<p>“It was not a bright day at all, but a wild, gloomy, stormy
night,” said the old woman, who, unperceived, had followed
her son to watch the success of his expedition.</p>

<p>“No matter for that,” said Terry; “there never was so
bright a day in your seven generations as that dark night; I
am now the richest man of my name, and I would not, this
mortal minute, call Lord De Vesci my uncle.”</p>

<p>It is easier for the reader to imagine than for the writer to
describe the manner in which this joyful day was passed by
the happy mother and son. Now counting and examining the
gold, and again proposing plans, and considering the best
purposes to which it could be applied, they passed the hours
until the summer sun had long sunk behind the crimson
west.</p>

<p>Terry was again in bed, when he started with a wild shriek.
“Mother of mercy!” he frantically vociferated, “here is the
Boccough Ruadh; I hear the tramp of his wooden leg on the
floor.”</p>

<p>“Lord save us!” said the old woman in a trembling voice,
“what can ail him now? Maybe it’s more money he has hid
somewhere else.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do you hear how he rattles about! Devil a <i lang="ga">kippeen</i>
in the cabin but he will destroy,” exclaimed poor Terry.
“It’s the black day to us that ever we seen himself or
his dirty thrash of money; and if God saves me till morning,
I’ll go back and lave every rap ov id where I got it.”</p>

<p>“That would be a murdher to lave so much fine money
moulding in the clay, and so many in want of it; you shall do
no such thing,” said the mother.</p>

<p>“I don’t care a straw for that,” said Terry. “I would
not have the ould sinner, God rest his sowl, stravagin’ every
other night about my honest decent cabin for all the goold
in the Queen’s County.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” says the old woman, “go to the priest in the
morning, and leave him the money, and let him dispose of it
as he likes for the good of the ould vagabond’s misforthunate
soul.”</p>

<p>This plan was agreed to, and the conversation dropt. The
ghost of the Boccough still rattled and clanked about the
house. He never ceased stumping about, from the kitchen to
the room, and from the room to the kitchen. Pots and pans,
plates and pitchers, were tossed here and there; the dog was
kicked, the cat was mauled, and even the raked-up fire was
lashed out of the “gree-sough.” In fact, Terry declared
that if the devil or Captain Rock was about the place, there
couldn’t be more noise than there was that night with the
Boccough’s ghost, and this continued without intermission
until the bell of Abbeyleix castle clock was tolling the midnight
hour.</p>

<p>Terry was up next morning at sunrise, and having packed
up the money which was the cause of all his trouble in his
mother’s check apron, proceeded with a heavy heart to the
residence of the priest, about two miles from the present
Poor-man’s Bridge. The priest was not up when Terry arrived,
but being well known to the domestics, he was admitted
to his bed-chamber.</p>

<p>“You have started early,” said the priest; “what troubles
you now, Terry?”</p>

<p>Terry gave a full and true account of his troubles, and
concluded by telling him that he brought him the money to
dispose of it as he thought best.</p>

<p>“I won’t have any thing to do with it,” said the Father.
“It is not mine, so you may take it back again the same
road.”</p>

<p>“Not a rap of it will ever go my road again,” said Terry.
“Can’t you give it for his unfortunate ould sowl?”</p>

<p>“I’ll have no hand in it,” said the priest.</p>

<p>“Nor I either,” said Terry. “I wouldn’t have the ould
miser <i lang="ga">polthogueing</i> about my quiet floor another night for the
king’s ransom.”</p>

<p>“Well, take it to your landlord; he is a magistrate, and
he will have it put to some public works connected with the
county,” said the priest.</p>

<p>“Bad luck to the lord or lady I’ll ever take it to,” said
Terry, making a spring, and bounding down the stairs, leaving
the money, apron and all, on the floor at the priest’s bedside.</p>

<p>“Come back, come back!” shouted the Father in a towering
passion.</p>

<p>“Good morning to your ravirince,” said Terry, as he flew
with the swiftness of a mountain deer over the common before
the priest’s door. “Ay, go back, indeed; catch ould birds
with chaff. You have the money now, and you may make a
bog or a dog of it, whichever you plaise.”</p>

<p>In an hour after, the priest’s servant man was on the road
to Maryborough, mounted on the priest’s own black gelding,
with a sealed parcel containing the Boccough’s money strapped
in a portmanteau behind him, and a letter to the treasurer
of the Queen’s County grand jury, detailing the curious circumstances
by which it came into his possession, and recommending
him to convert it to whatever purpose the gentlemen
of the county should deem most expedient.</p>

<p>The summer assizes came on in a few days, and the matter
was brought before the grand jury, who agreed to expend
the money in constructing a stone bridge over the ford where
it was collected.</p>

<p>Before that day twelvemonth, the ford had disappeared,
and a noble bridge of seven arches spanned the sparkling
waters of the Nore, which is here pretty broad and of considerable
depth. From that day to this it is called the “Poor-man’s
Bridge,” and I never cross it without thinking of the
strange circumstances which led to its erection.</p>

<p>The spirit of the Boccough Ruadh never troubled Terry
O’Shea after, but often, as people say, amid the gloom of a
winter’s night, or the grey haze of a summer’s evening, may
the figure of a wan and decrepid old man with his head enveloped
in a red nightcap, be seen wandering about Poor-man’s
Bridge, or walking quite “natural” over the glassy
waters of the transparent Nore.</p>

beggar, who asked alms of him. “How is this,” inquired
Miravaux, “that a lusty fellow like you is unemployed?”
“Ah!” replied the beggar, looking very piteously at him, “if

and unexpected, that Miravaux gave the varlet a piece of
silver.</p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">An Incident.</span>&mdash;At the time Commodore Elliot commanded
the navy at Norfolk (I think it was), happening to be conducting
a number of ladies and gentlemen who were visiting
the yard, he chanced to see a little boy who had a basket full
of chips, which he had gathered in the yard; probably to
show his importance he saluted him, and asked where he got
the chips. “In the yard,” replied the boy. “Then drop
them,” said the brave man. The little boy dropped the chips
as he was ordered, and after gaining a safe distance, turning
round with his thumb to his nose, said, “That is the first
prize you ever took, any how!”</p>

<p class="gap4">If there be a lot on earth worthy of envy, it is that of a

object of his thoughts. Let him divine the sorrows
and anticipate the wishes of his friends.</p>

<p class="gap4">A cheerful heart paints the world as it finds it, like a
sunny landscape; the morbid mind depicts it like a sterile
wilderness, palled with thick vapours, and dark as “the
shadow of death.” It is the mirror, in short, on which it is
caught, which lends to the face of nature the aspect of its
own turbulence or tranquillity.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
